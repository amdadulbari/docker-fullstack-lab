# .dockerignore - Files and directories excluded from the Docker build context
# Keeping the build context small speeds up builds and avoids accidentally
# baking secrets or large unnecessary files into the image.

# Never bundle installed packages — they are installed fresh by npm ci in the Dockerfile
node_modules/

# Exclude actual environment files that may contain secrets.
# .env.example is intentionally NOT excluded because it is safe to include as documentation.
