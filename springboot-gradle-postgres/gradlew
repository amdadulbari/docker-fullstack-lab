This is a placeholder file.

The real Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) is generated by running:

    gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.6

inside the project root on a machine that has Gradle installed, or it is
produced automatically inside the Docker builder stage (gradle:8.6-jdk17-alpine
image) during `docker compose up --build`.

For local development without Docker you have two options:

Option A — Use a system-installed Gradle:
    gradle bootRun

Option B — Generate the real wrapper first, then use it:
    gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.6
    ./gradlew bootRun

The Docker build does NOT rely on this file; it runs Gradle directly from the
base image, so no wrapper needs to be present in the repository.
